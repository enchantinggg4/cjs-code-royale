# TODO:
- Tweak parameters so queen doesn't freak out
- Tweak parameters so archers are more prioritized
- Tweak params so far "safe" mines are taken or for panic shelter
- Make archers depend on enemy racks count, not current amount of knights
- If we are safing near tower, grow it / juke
- Prioritize untaken sites for tower shelters
- Tweak knight radius and strength for tower x 4 situation
- Fix enemy tower affecting hole fucking map
- TODO: implement pathfinding
- TODO: maybe optimize safety matrix and in future make compatible with pathfinding(use own grid with low seed)
