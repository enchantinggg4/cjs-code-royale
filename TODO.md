# TODO:
- Tweak parameters so archers are more prioritized
- Tweak params so far "safe" mines are taken or for panic shelter
- Fix enemy tower affecting hole fucking map
- TODO: implement pathfinding
- TODO: maybe optimize safety matrix and in future make compatible with pathfinding(use own grid with low seed)
- TODO: adapt to the queen's health(we almost always win in macro game but lose in rushes)
